					<p>The Energy Monitoring System is designed to monitor the energy generation and distribution of energy in a mini-grid. Its structure is in in the following set up:<br>
Grid Management System (GMS) – This allows the user to manage the mini-grids effectively. The GMS works on the principle of easy access, use and display of data. It takes raw data and structures it into information that can be interpreted for different uses.
The GMS allows the user to add, remove, modify and extract data from the performance of a grid in energy. This data is visualized well in two sections which incorporate static data which has been collected over time and a live feed section of dynamic data that is instantaneous and reflective on the GMS
Moreover, the GMS allows one to tally the connections in the selected grid inclusive. This enables the plant operator to determine distribution energy patterns.<br>

User Management System (UMS) – This allows the user to manage the users effectively, the UMS is designed on the principle of privileges, which means users have hierarchy of access to the system. Moreover, the UMS allows the users of the system to interact in an active forum to determine the best way forward for the system. The energy monitoring system being open-source needs a platform of users for the communication, relaying of information and suggestions for improvement.<br>
The UMS allows the admin to add, remove and designate an access level to each user.
Moreover, the UMS allows one to track the performance of the system be defining in terms of usage, views from each user (To develop interest trends), as well as access times.<br>
Please find a user manual attached for your reference

**User manual is in development.</p>
